# @palmetto/sd-tailwind-v4
A collection of Style Dictionary transforms and formats tailored for tailwind v4.

Tailwind v4 made an impactful switch to how we convert design tokens to usable configuration for Tailwind. The configuraiton is moving from JS configs to CSS configs using CSS variables. JS configuration allows for simple style dictionary transforms and formats to simple JS POJOs that the JS configs can then parse. With CSS configuration, things get more challenging. This package provides a small suite of tranforms and formats to assist in your transition to Tailwind v4.

## Contributions Welcome!

We encourage contribution to make this suite of transforms and formats better!
